# Getting started

The [Common Ground (CG) Design System](https://gitlab.com/commonground/core/design-system) is a reusable component library that helps CG projects build UIs faster. The goal is to make building durable UIs more productive and satisfying.

## Installation

The components are written in React. The code examples are mostly JSX.

Add the Design System and the font to your project.

`npm install --save @commonground/design-system @fontsource/source-sans-pro`

Install the peer dependencies if you don't have these installed already.

`npm install --save formik react react-dom styled-components`

### Content Security Policy (CSP) settings

Some of the components load images via the data scheme (eg. base64 encoded images). Because of this, you might need to
loosen your application's CSP settings.

To enable loading images via the data scheme for the `image-src` directive, use `img-src 'self' data:;`.

## Usage

The `GlobalStyles` component needs to be included once. It contains the foundation (eg. normalize.css, typography...) which other components rely on.  
Also make sure to add the font source.

```
import { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'
import { GlobalStyles, defaultTheme } from '@commonground/design-system'
import '@fontsource/source-sans-pro/latin.css'
```

and in your App

```
  const App = () => {
    <div>
      <ThemeProvider theme={defaultTheme}>
        <GlobalStyles />
        <p>Welcome to my App!</p>
      </ThemeProvider>
    <div>
  }
```

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button } from ‘@commonground/design-system’;`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button variant="primary">Do something</Button>
    </div>
  )
```

## Customizing the theme

The Design System is build using design tokens. If you want to customize the theme, you can do so by overriding some of the tokens.

Lets say you want your webapp to have a green background.
We would have to update the token `backgroundColor` to achieve this.
Let's set it to to green (#00FF00).

### **theme.js**

```
import { defaultTheme } from '@commonground/design-system'

const tokens = {
  ...defaultTheme.tokens,
}

const theme = {
  ...defaultTheme,

  tokens,

  // Generics
  colorBackground: '#00FF00',
}

export default theme
```

### **app.js**

```
import myCustomTheme from './theme.js'

const App = () => {
    <div>
      <ThemeProvider theme={myCustomTheme}>
        <GlobalStyles />
        <p>Welcome to my customised App!</p>
      </ThemeProvider>
    <div>
  }
```
